<div class="block"><p>
 This class represents the basic building block for user interface components. A View
 occupies a rectangular area on the screen and is responsible for drawing and
 event handling. View is the base class for <em>widgets</em>, which are
 used to create interactive UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.). The
 <code>android.view.ViewGroup</code> subclass is the base class for <em>layouts</em>, which
 are invisible containers that hold other Views (or other ViewGroups) and define
 their layout properties.
 </p>

 <div class="special reference">
 <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
 <p>For information about using this class to develop your application's user interface,
 read the <a href="../..guide/topics/ui/index.html">User Interface</a> developer guide.
 </div>

 <a name="Using"></a>
 <h3>Using Views</h3>
 <p>
 All of the views in a window are arranged in a single tree. You can add views
 either from code or by specifying a tree of views in one or more XML layout
 files. There are many specialized subclasses of views that act as controls or
 are capable of displaying text, images, or other content.
 </p>
 <p>
 Once you have created a tree of views, there are typically a few types of
 common operations you may wish to perform:
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Set properties:</strong> for example setting the text of a
 <code>android.widget.TextView</code>. The available properties and the methods
 that set them will vary among the different subclasses of views. Note that
 properties that are known at build time can be set in the XML layout
 files.</li>
 <li><strong>Set focus:</strong> The framework will handled moving focus in
 response to user input. To force focus to a specific view, call
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#requestFocus--"><code>requestFocus()</code></a>.</li>
 <li><strong>Set up listeners:</strong> Views allow clients to set listeners
 that will be notified when something interesting happens to the view. For
 example, all views will let you set a listener to be notified when the view
 gains or loses focus. You can register such a listener using
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setOnFocusChangeListener-android.view.View.OnFocusChangeListener-"><code>setOnFocusChangeListener(android.view.View.OnFocusChangeListener)</code></a>.
 Other view subclasses offer more specialized listeners. For example, a Button
 exposes a listener to notify clients when the button is clicked.</li>
 <li><strong>Set visibility:</strong> You can hide or show views using
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setVisibility-int-"><code>setVisibility(int)</code></a>.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p><em>
 Note: The Android framework is responsible for measuring, laying out and
 drawing views. You should not call methods that perform these actions on
 views yourself unless you are actually implementing a
 <code>android.view.ViewGroup</code>.
 </em></p>

 <a name="Lifecycle"></a>
 <h3>Implementing a Custom View</h3>

 <p>
 To implement a custom view, you will usually begin by providing overrides for
 some of the standard methods that the framework calls on all views. You do
 not need to override all of these methods. In fact, you can start by just
 overriding <code>#onDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)</code>.

 <a name="IDs"></a>
 <h3>IDs</h3>
 Views may have an integer id associated with them. These ids are typically
 assigned in the layout XML files, and are used to find specific views within
 the view tree. A common pattern is to:
 <ul>
 <li>Define a Button in the layout file and assign it a unique ID.
 <pre>
 &lt;Button
     android:id="@+id/my_button"
     android:layout_width="wrap_content"
     android:layout_height="wrap_content"
     android:text="@string/my_button_text"/&gt;
 </pre></li>
 <li>From the onCreate method of an Activity, find the Button
 <pre class="prettyprint">
      Button myButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.my_button);
 </pre></li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 View IDs need not be unique throughout the tree, but it is good practice to
 ensure that they are at least unique within the part of the tree you are
 searching.
 </p>

 <a name="Position"></a>
 <h3>Position</h3>
 <p>
 The geometry of a view is that of a rectangle. A view has a location,
 expressed as a pair of <em>left</em> and <em>top</em> coordinates, and
 two dimensions, expressed as a width and a height. The unit for location
 and dimensions is the pixel.
 </p>

 <p>
 It is possible to retrieve the location of a view by invoking the methods
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getLeft--"><code>getLeft()</code></a> and <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getTop--"><code>getTop()</code></a>. The former returns the left, or X,
 coordinate of the rectangle representing the view. The latter returns the
 top, or Y, coordinate of the rectangle representing the view. These methods
 both return the location of the view relative to its parent. For instance,
 when getLeft() returns 20, that means the view is located 20 pixels to the
 right of the left edge of its direct parent.
 </p>

 <p>
 In addition, several convenience methods are offered to avoid unnecessary
 computations, namely <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getRight--"><code>getRight()</code></a> and <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getBottom--"><code>getBottom()</code></a>.
 These methods return the coordinates of the right and bottom edges of the
 rectangle representing the view. For instance, calling <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getRight--"><code>getRight()</code></a>
 is similar to the following computation: <code>getLeft() + getWidth()</code>
 (see <a href="#SizePaddingMargins">Size</a> for more information about the width.)
 </p>

 <a name="SizePaddingMargins"></a>
 <h3>Size, padding and margins</h3>
 <p>
 The size of a view is expressed with a width and a height. A view actually
 possess two pairs of width and height values.
 </p>

 <p>
 The first pair is known as <em>measured width</em> and
 <em>measured height</em>. These dimensions define how big a view wants to be
 within its parent (see <a href="#Layout">Layout</a> for more details.) The
 measured dimensions can be obtained by calling <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getMeasuredWidth--"><code>getMeasuredWidth()</code></a>
 and <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getMeasuredHeight--"><code>getMeasuredHeight()</code></a>.
 </p>

 <p>
 The second pair is simply known as <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>, or
 sometimes <em>drawing width</em> and <em>drawing height</em>. These
 dimensions define the actual size of the view on screen, at drawing time and
 after layout. These values may, but do not have to, be different from the
 measured width and height. The width and height can be obtained by calling
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getWidth--"><code>getWidth()</code></a> and <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getHeight--"><code>getHeight()</code></a>.
 </p>

 <p>
 To measure its dimensions, a view takes into account its padding. The padding
 is expressed in pixels for the left, top, right and bottom parts of the view.
 Padding can be used to offset the content of the view by a specific amount of
 pixels. For instance, a left padding of 2 will push the view's content by
 2 pixels to the right of the left edge. Padding can be set using the
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setPadding-int-int-int-int-"><code>setPadding(int, int, int, int)</code></a> or <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setPaddingRelative-int-int-int-int-"><code>setPaddingRelative(int, int, int, int)</code></a>
 method and queried by calling <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getPaddingLeft--"><code>getPaddingLeft()</code></a>, <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getPaddingTop--"><code>getPaddingTop()</code></a>,
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getPaddingRight--"><code>getPaddingRight()</code></a>, <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getPaddingBottom--"><code>getPaddingBottom()</code></a>, <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getPaddingStart--"><code>getPaddingStart()</code></a>,
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getPaddingEnd--"><code>getPaddingEnd()</code></a>.
 </p>

 <p>
 Even though a view can define a padding, it does not provide any support for
 margins. However, view groups provide such a support. Refer to
 <code>android.view.ViewGroup</code> and
 <code>android.view.ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams</code> for further information.
 </p>

 <a name="Layout"></a>
 <h3>Layout</h3>
 <p>
 Layout is a two pass process: a measure pass and a layout pass. The measuring
 pass is implemented in <a href="../../android/view/View.html#measure-int-int-"><code>measure(int, int)</code></a> and is a top-down traversal
 of the view tree. Each view pushes dimension specifications down the tree
 during the recursion. At the end of the measure pass, every view has stored
 its measurements. The second pass happens in
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#layout-int-int-int-int-"><code>layout(int,int,int,int)</code></a> and is also top-down. During
 this pass each parent is responsible for positioning all of its children
 using the sizes computed in the measure pass.
 </p>

 <p>
 When a view's measure() method returns, its <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getMeasuredWidth--"><code>getMeasuredWidth()</code></a> and
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#getMeasuredHeight--"><code>getMeasuredHeight()</code></a> values must be set, along with those for all of
 that view's descendants. A view's measured width and measured height values
 must respect the constraints imposed by the view's parents. This guarantees
 that at the end of the measure pass, all parents accept all of their
 children's measurements. A parent view may call measure() more than once on
 its children. For example, the parent may measure each child once with
 unspecified dimensions to find out how big they want to be, then call
 measure() on them again with actual numbers if the sum of all the children's
 unconstrained sizes is too big or too small.
 </p>

 <p>
 The measure pass uses two classes to communicate dimensions. The
 <a href="../../android/view/View.MeasureSpec.html" title="class in android.view"><code>View.MeasureSpec</code></a> class is used by views to tell their parents how they
 want to be measured and positioned. The base LayoutParams class just
 describes how big the view wants to be for both width and height. For each
 dimension, it can specify one of:
 <ul>
 <li> an exact number
 <li>MATCH_PARENT, which means the view wants to be as big as its parent
 (minus padding)
 <li> WRAP_CONTENT, which means that the view wants to be just big enough to
 enclose its content (plus padding).
 </ul>
 There are subclasses of LayoutParams for different subclasses of ViewGroup.
 For example, AbsoluteLayout has its own subclass of LayoutParams which adds
 an X and Y value.
 </p>

 <p>
 MeasureSpecs are used to push requirements down the tree from parent to
 child. A MeasureSpec can be in one of three modes:
 <ul>
 <li>UNSPECIFIED: This is used by a parent to determine the desired dimension
 of a child view. For example, a LinearLayout may call measure() on its child
 with the height set to UNSPECIFIED and a width of EXACTLY 240 to find out how
 tall the child view wants to be given a width of 240 pixels.
 <li>EXACTLY: This is used by the parent to impose an exact size on the
 child. The child must use this size, and guarantee that all of its
 descendants will fit within this size.
 <li>AT_MOST: This is used by the parent to impose a maximum size on the
 child. The child must guarantee that it and all of its descendants will fit
 within this size.
 </ul>
 </p>

 <p>
 To initiate a layout, call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#requestLayout--"><code>requestLayout()</code></a>. This method is typically
 called by a view on itself when it believes that is can no longer fit within
 its current bounds.
 </p>

 <a name="Drawing"></a>
 <h3>Drawing</h3>
 <p>
 Drawing is handled by walking the tree and recording the drawing commands of
 any View that needs to update. After this, the drawing commands of the
 entire tree are issued to screen, clipped to the newly damaged area.
 </p>

 <p>
 The tree is largely recorded and drawn in order, with parents drawn before
 (i.e., behind) their children, with siblings drawn in the order they appear
 in the tree. If you set a background drawable for a View, then the View will
 draw it before calling back to its <code>onDraw()</code> method. The child
 drawing order can be overridden with
 <code>custom child drawing order</code>
 in a ViewGroup, and with <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setZ-float-"><code>setZ(float)</code></a> custom Z values} set on Views.
 </p>

 <p>
 To force a view to draw, call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#invalidate--"><code>invalidate()</code></a>.
 </p>

 <a name="EventHandlingThreading"></a>
 <h3>Event Handling and Threading</h3>
 <p>
 The basic cycle of a view is as follows:
 <ol>
 <li>An event comes in and is dispatched to the appropriate view. The view
 handles the event and notifies any listeners.</li>
 <li>If in the course of processing the event, the view's bounds may need
 to be changed, the view will call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#requestLayout--"><code>requestLayout()</code></a>.</li>
 <li>Similarly, if in the course of processing the event the view's appearance
 may need to be changed, the view will call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#invalidate--"><code>invalidate()</code></a>.</li>
 <li>If either <a href="../../android/view/View.html#requestLayout--"><code>requestLayout()</code></a> or <a href="../../android/view/View.html#invalidate--"><code>invalidate()</code></a> were called,
 the framework will take care of measuring, laying out, and drawing the tree
 as appropriate.</li>
 </ol>
 </p>

 <p><em>Note: The entire view tree is single threaded. You must always be on
 the UI thread when calling any method on any view.</em>
 If you are doing work on other threads and want to update the state of a view
 from that thread, you should use a <code>Handler</code>.
 </p>

 <a name="FocusHandling"></a>
 <h3>Focus Handling</h3>
 <p>
 The framework will handle routine focus movement in response to user input.
 This includes changing the focus as views are removed or hidden, or as new
 views become available. Views indicate their willingness to take focus
 through the <a href="../../android/view/View.html#isFocusable--"><code>isFocusable()</code></a> method. To change whether a view can take
 focus, call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setFocusable-boolean-"><code>setFocusable(boolean)</code></a>.  When in touch mode (see notes below)
 views indicate whether they still would like focus via <a href="../../android/view/View.html#isFocusableInTouchMode--"><code>isFocusableInTouchMode()</code></a>
 and can change this via <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setFocusableInTouchMode-boolean-"><code>setFocusableInTouchMode(boolean)</code></a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Focus movement is based on an algorithm which finds the nearest neighbor in a
 given direction. In rare cases, the default algorithm may not match the
 intended behavior of the developer. In these situations, you can provide
 explicit overrides by using these XML attributes in the layout file:
 <pre>
 nextFocusDown
 nextFocusLeft
 nextFocusRight
 nextFocusUp
 </pre>
 </p>


 <p>
 To get a particular view to take focus, call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#requestFocus--"><code>requestFocus()</code></a>.
 </p>

 <a name="TouchMode"></a>
 <h3>Touch Mode</h3>
 <p>
 When a user is navigating a user interface via directional keys such as a D-pad, it is
 necessary to give focus to actionable items such as buttons so the user can see
 what will take input.  If the device has touch capabilities, however, and the user
 begins interacting with the interface by touching it, it is no longer necessary to
 always highlight, or give focus to, a particular view.  This motivates a mode
 for interaction named 'touch mode'.
 </p>
 <p>
 For a touch capable device, once the user touches the screen, the device
 will enter touch mode.  From this point onward, only views for which
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#isFocusableInTouchMode--"><code>isFocusableInTouchMode()</code></a> is true will be focusable, such as text editing widgets.
 Other views that are touchable, like buttons, will not take focus when touched; they will
 only fire the on click listeners.
 </p>
 <p>
 Any time a user hits a directional key, such as a D-pad direction, the view device will
 exit touch mode, and find a view to take focus, so that the user may resume interacting
 with the user interface without touching the screen again.
 </p>
 <p>
 The touch mode state is maintained across <code>android.app.Activity</code>s.  Call
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#isInTouchMode--"><code>isInTouchMode()</code></a> to see whether the device is currently in touch mode.
 </p>

 <a name="Scrolling"></a>
 <h3>Scrolling</h3>
 <p>
 The framework provides basic support for views that wish to internally
 scroll their content. This includes keeping track of the X and Y scroll
 offset as well as mechanisms for drawing scrollbars. See
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#scrollBy-int-int-"><code>scrollBy(int, int)</code></a>, <a href="../../android/view/View.html#scrollTo-int-int-"><code>scrollTo(int, int)</code></a>, and
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#awakenScrollBars--"><code>awakenScrollBars()</code></a> for more details.
 </p>

 <a name="Tags"></a>
 <h3>Tags</h3>
 <p>
 Unlike IDs, tags are not used to identify views. Tags are essentially an
 extra piece of information that can be associated with a view. They are most
 often used as a convenience to store data related to views in the views
 themselves rather than by putting them in a separate structure.
 </p>

 <a name="Properties"></a>
 <h3>Properties</h3>
 <p>
 The View class exposes an <a href="../../android/view/View.html#ALPHA"><code>ALPHA</code></a> property, as well as several transform-related
 properties, such as <a href="../../android/view/View.html#TRANSLATION_X"><code>TRANSLATION_X</code></a> and <a href="../../android/view/View.html#TRANSLATION_Y"><code>TRANSLATION_Y</code></a>. These properties are
 available both in the <code>Property</code> form as well as in similarly-named setter/getter
 methods (such as <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setAlpha-float-"><code>setAlpha(float)</code></a> for <a href="../../android/view/View.html#ALPHA"><code>ALPHA</code></a>). These properties can
 be used to set persistent state associated with these rendering-related properties on the view.
 The properties and methods can also be used in conjunction with
 <code>Animator</code>-based animations, described more in the
 <a href="#Animation">Animation</a> section.
 </p>

 <a name="Animation"></a>
 <h3>Animation</h3>
 <p>
 Starting with Android 3.0, the preferred way of animating views is to use the
 <code>android.animation</code> package APIs. These <code>Animator</code>-based
 classes change actual properties of the View object, such as <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setAlpha-float-"><code>alpha</code></a> and
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setTranslationX-float-"><code>translationX</code></a>. This behavior is contrasted to that of the pre-3.0
 <code>Animation</code>-based classes, which instead animate only
 how the view is drawn on the display. In particular, the <code>ViewPropertyAnimator</code> class
 makes animating these View properties particularly easy and efficient.
 </p>
 <p>
 Alternatively, you can use the pre-3.0 animation classes to animate how Views are rendered.
 You can attach an <code>Animation</code> object to a view using
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setAnimation-Animation-"><code>setAnimation(Animation)</code></a> or
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#startAnimation-Animation-"><code>startAnimation(Animation)</code></a>. The animation can alter the scale,
 rotation, translation and alpha of a view over time. If the animation is
 attached to a view that has children, the animation will affect the entire
 subtree rooted by that node. When an animation is started, the framework will
 take care of redrawing the appropriate views until the animation completes.
 </p>

 <a name="Security"></a>
 <h3>Security</h3>
 <p>
 Sometimes it is essential that an application be able to verify that an action
 is being performed with the full knowledge and consent of the user, such as
 granting a permission request, making a purchase or clicking on an advertisement.
 Unfortunately, a malicious application could try to spoof the user into
 performing these actions, unaware, by concealing the intended purpose of the view.
 As a remedy, the framework offers a touch filtering mechanism that can be used to
 improve the security of views that provide access to sensitive functionality.
 </p><p>
 To enable touch filtering, call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setFilterTouchesWhenObscured-boolean-"><code>setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(boolean)</code></a> or set the
 android:filterTouchesWhenObscured layout attribute to true.  When enabled, the framework
 will discard touches that are received whenever the view's window is obscured by
 another visible window.  As a result, the view will not receive touches whenever a
 toast, dialog or other window appears above the view's window.
 </p><p>
 For more fine-grained control over security, consider overriding the
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#onFilterTouchEventForSecurity-MotionEvent-"><code>onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent)</code></a> method to implement your own
 security policy. See also <code>MotionEvent#FLAG_WINDOW_IS_OBSCURED</code>.

<div class="block">Flag for <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setSystemUiVisibility-int-"><code>setSystemUiVisibility(int)</code></a>: View has requested to go
 into the normal fullscreen mode so that its content can take over the screen
 while still allowing the user to interact with the application.

 <p>This has the same visual effect as
 <code>WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN</code>,
 meaning that non-critical screen decorations (such as the status bar) will be
 hidden while the user is in the View's window, focusing the experience on
 that content.  Unlike the window flag, if you are using ActionBar in
 overlay mode with <code>Window.FEATURE_ACTION_BAR_OVERLAY</code>, then enabling this flag will also
 hide the action bar.

 <p>This approach to going fullscreen is best used over the window flag when
 it is a transient state -- that is, the application does this at certain
 points in its user interaction where it wants to allow the user to focus
 on content, but not as a continuous state.  For situations where the application
 would like to simply stay full screen the entire time (such as a game that
 wants to take over the screen), the
 <code>window flag</code>
 is usually a better approach.  The state set here will be removed by the system
 in various situations (such as the user moving to another application) like
 the other system UI states.

 <p>When using this flag, the application should provide some easy facility
 for the user to go out of it.  A common example would be in an e-book
 reader, where tapping on the screen brings back whatever screen and UI
 decorations that had been hidden while the user was immersed in reading
 the book.</div>

<div class="block">Flag for <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setSystemUiVisibility-int-"><code>setSystemUiVisibility(int)</code></a>: When using other layout
 flags, we would like a stable view of the content insets given to
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#fitSystemWindows-Rect-"><code>fitSystemWindows(Rect)</code></a>.  This means that the insets seen there
 will always represent the worst case that the application can expect
 as a continuous state.  In the stock Android UI this is the space for
 the system bar, nav bar, and status bar, but not more transient elements
 such as an input method.

 The stable layout your UI sees is based on the system UI modes you can
 switch to.  That is, if you specify <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN</code></a>
 then you will get a stable layout for changes of the
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN</code></a> mode; if you specify
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN</code></a> and
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION</code></a>, then you can transition
 to <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN</code></a> and <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION</code></a>
 with a stable layout.  (Note that you should avoid using
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION</code></a> by itself.)

 If you have set the window flag <code>WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_FULLSCREEN</code>
 to hide the status bar (instead of using <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN</code></a>),
 then a hidden status bar will be considered a "stable" state for purposes
 here.  This allows your UI to continually hide the status bar, while still
 using the system UI flags to hide the action bar while still retaining
 a stable layout.  Note that changing the window fullscreen flag will never
 provide a stable layout for a clean transition.

 <p>If you are using ActionBar in
 overlay mode with <code>Window.FEATURE_ACTION_BAR_OVERLAY</code>, this flag will also impact the
 insets it adds to those given to the application.</div>

 <p>Software layers have various usages:</p>

 <p>When the application is using hardware acceleration, a software layer
 is useful to render drawing primitives not supported by the hardware
 accelerated pipeline. It can also be used to cache a complex view tree
 into a texture and reduce the complexity of drawing operations. For instance,
 when animating a complex view tree with a translation, a software layer can
 be used to render the view tree only once.</p>
 <p>Software layers should be avoided when the affected view tree updates
 often. Every update will require to re-render the software layer, which can
 potentially be slow (particularly when hardware acceleration is turned on
 since the layer will have to be uploaded into a hardware texture after every
 update.)</p></div>

 insets to views. Views should override <a href="../../android/view/View.html#onApplyWindowInsets-WindowInsets-"><code>onApplyWindowInsets(WindowInsets)</code></a> or use
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener-android.view.View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener-"><code>setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(android.view.View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener)</code></a>
 to implement handling their own insets.</span></div>
<div class="block">Called by the view hierarchy when the content insets for a window have
 changed, to allow it to adjust its content to fit within those windows.
 The content insets tell you the space that the status bar, input method,
 and other system windows infringe on the application's window.

 <p>You do not normally need to deal with this function, since the default
 window decoration given to applications takes care of applying it to the
 content of the window.  If you use <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN</code></a>
 or <a href="../../android/view/View.html#SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION"><code>SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION</code></a> this will not be the case,
 and your content can be placed under those system elements.  You can then
 use this method within your view hierarchy if you have parts of your UI
 which you would like to ensure are not being covered.

 <p>The default implementation of this method simply applies the content
 insets to the view's padding, consuming that content (modifying the
 insets to be 0), and returning true.  This behavior is off by default, but can
 be enabled through <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setFitsSystemWindows-boolean-"><code>setFitsSystemWindows(boolean)</code></a>.

 <p>This function's traversal down the hierarchy is depth-first.  The same content
 insets object is propagated down the hierarchy, so any changes made to it will
 be seen by all following views (including potentially ones above in
 the hierarchy since this is a depth-first traversal).  The first view
 that returns true will abort the entire traversal.

 <p>The default implementation works well for a situation where it is
 used with a container that covers the entire window, allowing it to
 apply the appropriate insets to its content on all edges.  If you need
 a more complicated layout (such as two different views fitting system
 windows, one on the top of the window, and one on the bottom),
 you can override the method and handle the insets however you would like.
 Note that the insets provided by the framework are always relative to the
 far edges of the window, not accounting for the location of the called view
 within that window.  (In fact when this method is called you do not yet know
 where the layout will place the view, as it is done before layout happens.)

 <p>Note: unlike many View methods, there is no dispatch phase to this
 call.  If you are overriding it in a ViewGroup and want to allow the
 call to continue to your children, you must be sure to call the super
 implementation.

 <p>Here is a sample layout that makes use of fitting system windows
 to have controls for a video view placed inside of the window decorations
 that it hides and shows.  This can be used with code like the second
 sample (video player) shown in <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setSystemUiVisibility-int-"><code>setSystemUiVisibility(int)</code></a>.

<div class="block">Called when the view should apply <code>WindowInsets</code> according to its internal policy.

 <p>This method should be overridden by views that wish to apply a policy different from or

 to apply insets should call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#dispatchApplyWindowInsets-WindowInsets-"><code>dispatchApplyWindowInsets(WindowInsets)</code></a>.</p>

 <p>Clients may supply an <a href="../../android/view/View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener.html" title="interface in android.view"><code>View.OnApplyWindowInsetsListener</code></a> to a view. If one is set
 it will be called during dispatch instead of this method. The listener may optionally

 insets policy in addition to its own.</p>

 <p>Implementations of this method should either return the insets parameter unchanged
 or a new <code>WindowInsets</code> cloned from the supplied insets with any insets consumed
 that this view applied itself. This allows new inset types added in future platform
 versions to pass through existing implementations unchanged without being erroneously
 consumed.</p>

 <p>By default if a view's <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setFitsSystemWindows-boolean-"><code>fitsSystemWindows</code></a>

<div class="block"><p>Sets the distance along the Z axis (orthogonal to the X/Y plane on which
 views are drawn) from the camera to this view. The camera's distance
 affects 3D transformations, for instance rotations around the X and Y
 axis. If the rotationX or rotationY properties are changed and this view is
 large (more than half the size of the screen), it is recommended to always
 use a camera distance that's greater than the height (X axis rotation) or
 the width (Y axis rotation) of this view.</p>

 <p>The distance of the camera from the view plane can have an affect on the
 perspective distortion of the view when it is rotated around the x or y axis.
 For example, a large distance will result in a large viewing angle, and there
 will not be much perspective distortion of the view as it rotates. A short
 distance may cause much more perspective distortion upon rotation, and can
 also result in some drawing artifacts if the rotated view ends up partially
 behind the camera (which is why the recommendation is to use a distance at
 least as far as the size of the view, if the view is to be rotated.)</p>

 <p>The distance is expressed in "depth pixels." The default distance depends
 on the screen density. For instance, on a medium density display, the
 default distance is 1280. On a high density display, the default distance
 is 1920.</p>

 <p>If you want to specify a distance that leads to visually consistent
 results across various densities, use the following formula:</p>
 <pre>
 float scale = context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;
 view.setCameraDistance(distance * scale);
 </pre>

 <p>The density scale factor of a high density display is 1.5,
 and 1920 = 1280 * 1.5.</p></div>

<h4>hasOverlappingRendering</h4>
<pre>public&nbsp;boolean&nbsp;hasOverlappingRendering()</pre>
<div class="block">Returns whether this View has content which overlaps.

 <p>This function, intended to be overridden by specific View types, is an optimization when
 alpha is set on a view. If rendering overlaps in a view with alpha < 1, that view is drawn to
 an offscreen buffer and then composited into place, which can be expensive. If the view has
 no overlapping rendering, the view can draw each primitive with the appropriate alpha value
 directly. An example of overlapping rendering is a TextView with a background image, such as
 a Button. An example of non-overlapping rendering is a TextView with no background, or an
 ImageView with only the foreground image. The default implementation returns true; subclasses
 should override if they have cases which can be optimized.</p>

 <p>The current implementation of the saveLayer and saveLayerAlpha methods in <code>Canvas</code>
 necessitates that a View return true if it uses the methods internally without passing the
 <code>Canvas#CLIP_TO_LAYER_SAVE_FLAG</code>.</p></div>

<pre>public&nbsp;void&nbsp;setAlpha(float&nbsp;alpha)</pre>
<div class="block">Sets the opacity of the view to a value from 0 to 1, where 0 means the view is
 completely transparent and 1 means the view is completely opaque.

 <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> setting alpha to a translucent value (0 < alpha < 1)
 can have significant performance implications, especially for large views. It is best to use
 the alpha property sparingly and transiently, as in the case of fading animations.</p>

 <p>For a view with a frequently changing alpha, such as during a fading animation, it is
 strongly recommended for performance reasons to either override
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#hasOverlappingRendering--"><code>hasOverlappingRendering()</code></a> to return <code>false</code> if appropriate, or setting a
 <code>layer type</code> on the view for the duration
 of the animation. On versions <code>android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M</code> and below,
 the default path for rendering an unlayered View with alpha could add multiple milliseconds
 of rendering cost, even for simple or small views. Starting with
 <code>android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M</code>, <a href="../../android/view/View.html#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE"><code>LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE</code></a> is automatically
 applied to the view at the rendering level.</p>

 <p>If this view overrides <a href="../../android/view/View.html#onSetAlpha-int-"><code>onSetAlpha(int)</code></a> to return true, then this view is
 responsible for applying the opacity itself.</p>

 <p>On versions <code>android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP_MR1</code> and below, note that if
 the view is backed by a <code>layer</code> and is
 associated with a <code>layer paint</code>, setting an
 alpha value less than 1.0 will supersede the alpha of the layer paint.</p>

 <p>Starting with <code>android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M</code>, setting a translucent alpha
 value will clip a View to its bounds, unless the View returns <code>false</code> from
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#hasOverlappingRendering--"><code>hasOverlappingRendering()</code></a>.</p></div>

 Measure the view and its content to determine the measured width and the

 measurement of their contents.
 </p>

 <p>
 <strong>CONTRACT:</strong> When overriding this method, you
 <em>must</em> call <a href="../../android/view/View.html#setMeasuredDimension-int-int-"><code>setMeasuredDimension(int, int)</code></a> to store the
 measured width and height of this view. Failure to do so will trigger an

 override <a href="../../android/view/View.html#onMeasure-int-int-"><code>onMeasure(int, int)</code></a> to provide better measurements of
 their content.

 If this method is overridden, it is the subclass's responsibility to make
 sure the measured height and width are at least the view's minimum height

<pre>public&nbsp;void&nbsp;setSystemUiVisibility(int&nbsp;visibility)</pre>
<div class="block">Request that the visibility of the status bar or other screen/window
 decorations be changed.

 <p>This method is used to put the over device UI into temporary modes
 where the user's attention is focused more on the application content,
 by dimming or hiding surrounding system affordances.  This is typically
 used in conjunction with <code>Window.FEATURE_ACTION_BAR_OVERLAY</code>, allowing the applications content
 to be placed behind the action bar (and with these flags other system
 affordances) so that smooth transitions between hiding and showing them
 can be done.

 <p>Two representative examples of the use of system UI visibility is
 implementing a content browsing application (like a magazine reader)
 and a video playing application.

 <p>The first code shows a typical implementation of a View in a content
 browsing application.  In this implementation, the application goes
 into a content-oriented mode by hiding the status bar and action bar,
 and putting the navigation elements into lights out mode.  The user can
 then interact with content while in this mode.  Such an application should
 provide an easy way for the user to toggle out of the mode (such as to
 check information in the status bar or access notifications).  In the
 implementation here, this is done simply by tapping on the content.

 

 <p>This second code sample shows a typical implementation of a View
 in a video playing application.  In this situation, while the video is
 playing the application would like to go into a complete full-screen mode,
 to use as much of the display as possible for the video.  When in this state
 the user can not interact with the application; the system intercepts
 touching on the screen to pop the UI out of full screen mode.  See
 <a href="../../android/view/View.html#fitSystemWindows-Rect-"><code>fitSystemWindows(Rect)</code></a> for a sample layout that goes with this code.

 system calls this object's <a href="../../android/view/View.DragShadowBuilder.html#onProvideShadowMetrics-Point-Point-"><code>View.DragShadowBuilder.onProvideShadowMetrics(Point, Point)</code></a>

 <p>
  Once the system has the drag shadow, it begins the drag and drop operation by sending
  drag events to all the View objects in your application that are currently visible. It does
  this either by calling the View object's drag listener (an implementation of
  <a href="../../android/view/View.OnDragListener.html#onDrag-android.view.View-DragEvent-"><code>onDrag()</code></a> or by calling the
  View object's <a href="../../android/view/View.html#onDragEvent-DragEvent-"><code>onDragEvent()</code></a> method.
  Both are passed a <code>android.view.DragEvent</code> object that has a
  <code>android.view.DragEvent#getAction()</code> value of
  <code>android.view.DragEvent#ACTION_DRAG_STARTED</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Your application can invoke startDrag() on any attached View object. The View object does not
 need to be the one used in <a href="../../android/view/View.DragShadowBuilder.html" title="class in android.view"><code>View.DragShadowBuilder</code></a>, nor does it need to
 be related to the View the user selected for dragging.

 suitable conditions for a fling. Generally this means that a touch scroll has ended with a

<div class="block">Dispatch a fling to a nested scrolling parent before it is processed by this view.

 <p>Nested pre-fling events are to nested fling events what touch intercept is to touch
 and what nested pre-scroll is to nested scroll. <code>dispatchNestedPreFling</code>
 offsets an opportunity for the parent view in a nested fling to fully consume the fling
 before the child view consumes it. If this method returns <code>true</code>, a nested
 parent view consumed the fling and this view should not scroll as a result.</p>

 <p>For a better user experience, only one view in a nested scrolling chain should consume
 the fling at a time. If a parent view consumed the fling this method will return false.
 Custom view implementations should account for this in two ways:</p>

 <ul>
     <li>If a custom view is paged and needs to settle to a fixed page-point, do not
     call <code>dispatchNestedPreFling</code>; consume the fling and settle to a valid
     position regardless.</li>
     <li>If a nested parent does consume the fling, this view should not scroll at all,
     even to settle back to a valid idle position.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Views should also not offer fling velocities to nested parent views along an axis
 where scrolling is not currently supported; a <code>ScrollView</code>
 should not offer a horizontal fling velocity to its parents since scrolling along that
 axis is not permitted and carrying velocity along that motion does not make sense.</p></div>
